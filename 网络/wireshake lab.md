The goal of this first lab was primarily to introduce you to Wireshark. The following  
questions will demonstrate that you’ve been able to get Wireshark up and running, and  
have explored some of its capabilities. Answer the following questions, based on your  
Wireshark experimentation:  
  
1. List 3 different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the unfiltered  packet-listing window in step 7 above.  
2. How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK reply was received? (By default, the value of the Time column in the packet-  listing window is the amount of time, in seconds, since Wireshark tracing began.  To display the Time field in time-of-day format, select the Wireshark View pull  down menu, then select Time Display Format, then select Time-of-day.)
